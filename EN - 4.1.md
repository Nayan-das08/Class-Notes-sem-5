# Physical connection
- diff types of connectoins are used as per requirement and other factors
- connects two or more NICs
- same level of performance is not offered by all physical connections

>[!NOTE]
>connecting two ends of fibre optics - splicing

# physical layer
transports bits on the channel
encodes and decodes the frame

# physical components
hardware devices that transmit the signals representing the bits on the channel

# encoding
- converts the stream of bits into a form that is recognised by the next device 
- methods - Manchester algo, 4B/5B, 8B/10B

# signalling
- how bits are represented in the media
- change in intensity of light, frequencies, voltage, etc.

# bandwidth
- amount of data that can flow through a channel in a given amount of time
- units - bps and so on

## latency 
some delay for data transmission

## throughput
measure of bits transferred over a given period time

## goodput
throughput - traffic overhead (latency)
