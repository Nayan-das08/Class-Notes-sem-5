# biggest problem - Political Polarization 

## problem
political polarization is when society gets divided into factions because they are influenced by the political leaders they revere. The problem arises when people do not view the big picture and form uninformed opinions and act as if their version is the only truth. 

People become argumentative, turn unimportant issues into national debates, and follow whatever their leaders say blindly without.

Because of this we steer away from stories and topics that are of more importance.

## origin
- need of people to belong in a group
