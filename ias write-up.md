I am a B.Tech. CSE (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning hons.) student at Amity University, Noida. I would like to apply for the Science Academies Summer Research Fellowship Program for Students 2023 in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and its subsidiary branches like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, etc. These fields interest me the most  

Some of the work done by me in this field are: -
1.      Solving Partial Differential Equations using Deep Learning Techniques.
2.      Fire Detection Alarm System using Deep Learning.
3.      I am currently working on a project on LSTM and its usage in botnet attack detection.

I intend to work on Artificial Intelligence (or related fields), learn how the theoretical aspects help in creating new solutions to real-world problems and
