## summary
### Application, Presentation, and Session
- In the OSI and the TCP/IP models, the application layer is the closest layer to the end user
- Application layer protocols are used to exchange data between programs running on the source and destination hosts
- The presentation layer has three primary functions: formatting, or presenting, data at the source device into a compatible form for receipt by the destination device, compressing data in a way that can be decompressed by the destination device, and encrypting data for transmission and decrypting data upon receipt
- The session layer creates and maintains dialogs between source and destination applications
- The session layer handles the exchange of information to initiate dialogs, keep them active, and to restart sessions that are disrupted or idle for a long period of time
- TCP/IP application layer protocols specify the format and control information necessary for many common internet communication functions
- These protocols are used by both the source and destination devices during a session
- The protocols implemented on both the source and destination host must be compatible

### Peer-to-Peer
- In the client/server model, the device requesting the information is called a client and the device responding to the request is called a server
- The client begins the exchange by requesting data from the server, which responds by sending one or more streams of data to the client
- In a P2P network, two or more computers are connected via a network and can share resources without having a dedicated server
- Every peer can function as both a server and a client
- One computer might assume the role of server for one transaction while simultaneously serving as a client for another
- P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service
- Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory
- Many P2P applications allow users to share pieces of files with each other at the same time
- Clients use a small file called a torrent file to locate other users who have pieces that they need so that they can connect directly to them
- This file also contains information about tracker computers that keep track of which users have what pieces of which files

### Web and Email Protocols
- When a web address or URL is typed into a web browser, the web browser establishes a connection to the web service
- The web service is running on the server that is using the HTTP protocol
- HTTP is a request/response protocol
- When a client, typically a web browser, sends a request to a web server, HTTP specifies the message types used for that communication
- The three common message types are GET, POST, and PUT
- For secure communication across the internet, HTTPS uses the same client request-server response process as HTTP, but the data stream is encrypted with SSL before being transported across the network
- Email supports three separate protocols for operation: SMTP, POP, and IMAP
- The application layer process that sends mail uses SMTP
- A client retrieves email using POP or IMAP
- SMTP message formats require a message header and a message body
- While the message body can contain any amount of text, the message header must have a properly formatted recipient email address and a sender address
- POP is used by an application to retrieve mail from a mail server
- With POP, mail is downloaded from the server to the client and then deleted on the server
- With IMAP, unlike POP, when the user connects to an IMAP-capable server, copies of the messages are downloaded to the client application
- The original messages are kept on the server until manually deleted

### IP Addressing Services
- The DNS protocol matches resource names with the required numeric network address
- The DNS protocol communications use a message format for all types of client queries and server responses, error messages, and the transfer of resource record information between servers
- DNS uses domain names to form a hierarchy
- Each DNS server maintains a specific database file and is only responsible for managing name-to-IP mappings for that small portion of the entire DNS structure
- Computer OSs use Nslookup to allow the user to manually query the name servers to resolve a given host name
- DHCP for IPv4 service automates the assignment of IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other IPv4 networking parameters
- DHCPv6 provides similar services for IPv6 clients, except that it does not provide a default gateway address
- When an IPv4, DHCP-configured device boots up or connects to the network, the client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to identify any available DHCP servers on the network
- A DHCP server replies with a DHCPOFFER message, which offers a lease to the client
- DHCPv6 has a set of messages that is similar to those for DHCPv4
- The DHCPv6 messages are SOLICIT, ADVERTISE, INFORMATION REQUEST, and REPLY

### File Sharing Services
- An FTP client is an application which runs on a computer that is being used to push and pull data from an FTP server
- The client establishes the first connection to the server for control traffic using TCP port 21
- The client establishes the second connection to the server for the actual data transfer using TCP port 20
- The client can download (pull) data from the server, or the client can upload (push) data to the server
- Here are three functions of SMB messages: start, authenticate, and terminate sessions, control file and printer access, and allow an application to send or receive messages to or from another device
- Unlike the file sharing supported by FTP, clients establish a long-term connection to servers
- After the connection is established, the user of the client can access the resources on the server as if the resource is local to the client host
