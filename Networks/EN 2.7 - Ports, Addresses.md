# IP address
identity of a device in a network
2 types - IPv4 and IPv6

## ways to set IP address
1. dynamically using DHCP protocol
2. adding manually

## IPv6 address
- 128 bit address
- 8 terms, 4 hex digits in each term
- can be shortened
- eg: `2001:db8:acad:10::10` is shortened from `2001:0db8:acad:0010:0000:0000:0000:0010`
- double colon - there are `0000` in between
- **subnet prefix** - 24 for IPv4 and IPv6
	- `192.168.10.1/24`, here 24 means for subnet mask, 24 bits are 1 rest are 0

# Interface
## factors for various types of media
1. distance the media can carry a signal
2. environment (weather, terrain, etc.)
3. Cost of the media
4. amount and speed of data to be transmitted
