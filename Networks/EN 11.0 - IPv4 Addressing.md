## summary

### IPv4 Addressing Structure
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit hierarchical address that is made up of a network portion and a host portion
- The bits within the network portion of the address must be identical for all devices that reside in the same network
- The bits within the host portion of the address must be unique to identify a specific host within a network
- A host requires a unique IPv4 address and a subnet mask to show the network/host portions of the address
- The prefix length is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask

### IPv4 Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast

Unicast transmission refers to a device sending a message to one other device in one-to-one communications. A unicast packet is a packet with a destination IP address that is a unicast address which is the address of a single recipient. Broadcast transmission refers to a device sending a message to all the devices on a network in one-to-all communications. A broadcast packet has a destination IP address with all ones (1s) in the host portion, or 32 one (1) bits. Multicast transmission reduces traffic by allowing a host to send a single packet to a selected set of hosts that subscribe to a multicast group. A multicast packet is a packet with a destination IP address that is a multicast address. IPv4 has reserved the 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 addresses as a multicast range.

### Types of IPv4 Addresses
- Public IPv4 addresses are globally routed between ISP routers
- Not all available IPv4 addresses can be used on the internet
- There are blocks of addresses called private addresses that are used by most organizations to assign IPv4 addresses to internal hosts
- Most internal networks use private IPv4 addresses for addressing all internal devices (intranet); however, these private addresses are not globally routable
- Loopback addresses used by a host to direct traffic back to itself
- Link-local addresses are more commonly known as APIPA addresses, or self-assigned addresses
- In 1981, IPv4 addresses were assigned using classful addressing: A, B, or C
- Public IPv4 addresses must be unique, and are globally routed over the internet
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by the IANA, which allocates blocks of IP addresses to the RIRs

### Network Segmentation
- In an Ethernet LAN, devices broadcast to locate other devices using ARP
- Switches propagate broadcasts out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received
- Routers do not propagate broadcasts, instead each router interface connects a broadcast domain and broadcasts are only propagated within that specific domain
- A large broadcast domain is a network that connects many hosts
- A problem with a large broadcast domain is that these hosts can generate excessive broadcasts and negatively affect the network
- The solution is to reduce the size of the network to create smaller broadcast domains in a process called subnetting
- These smaller network spaces are called subnets
- Subnetting reduces overall network traffic and improves network performance
- An administrator may subnet by location, between networks, or by device type

### Subnet an IPv4 Network
- IPv4 subnets are created by using one or more of the host bits as network bits
- This is done by extending the subnet mask to borrow some of the bits from the host portion of the address to create additional network bits
- The more host bits that are borrowed, the more subnets that can be defined
- The more bits that are borrowed to increase the number of subnets also reduces the number of hosts per subnet
- Networks are most easily subnetted at the octet boundary of /8, /16, and /24
- Subnets can borrow bits from any host bit position to create other masks

### Subnet a /16 and a /8 Prefix
- In a situation requiring a larger number of subnets, an IPv4 network is required that has more hosts bits available to borrow
- To create subnets, you must borrow bits from the host portion of the IPv4 address of the existing internetwork
- Starting from the left to the right with the first available host bit, borrow a single bit at a time until you reach the number of bits necessary to create the number of subnets required
- When borrowing bits from a /16 address, start borrowing bits in the third octet, going from left to right
- The first address is reserved for the network address and the last address is reserved for the broadcast address

### Subnet to Meet Requirements

- A typical enterprise network contains an intranet and a DMZ
- Both have subnetting requirements and challenges
- The intranet uses private IPv4 addressing space
- The 10.0.0.0/8 can also be subnetted using any other number of prefix lengths, such as /12, /18, /20, etc giving the network administrator many options
- Because these devices need to be publicly accessible from the internet, the devices in the DMZ require public IPv4 addresses
- Organizations must maximize their own limited number of public IPv4 addresses
- To reduce the number of unused host addresses per subnet, the network administrator must subnet their public address space into subnets with different subnet masks
- This is known as Variable Subnet Length Masking (VLSM)
- Administrators must consider how many host addresses are required for each network, and how many subnets are needed

### Variable Length Subnet Masking
- Traditional subnetting might meet an organizationâ€™s needs for its largest LAN and divide the address space into an adequate number of subnets
- But it likely also results in significant waste of unused addresses
- VLSM allows a network space to be divided into unequal parts
- With VLSM, the subnet mask will vary depending on how many bits have been borrowed for a particular subnet (this is the variable part of the VLSM)
- VLSM is just subnetting a subnet
- When using VLSM, always begin by satisfying the host requirements of the largest subnet
- Continue subnetting until the host requirements of the smallest subnet are satisfied
- Subnets always need to be started on an appropriate bit boundary

### Structured Design
- A network administrator should study the network requirements to better plan how the IPv4 network subnets will be structured
- This means looking at the entire network, both the intranet and the DMZ, and determining how each area will be segmented
- The address plan includes determining where address conservation is needed (usually within the DMZ), and where there is more flexibility (usually within the intranet)
- Where address conservation is required the plan should determine how many subnets are needed and how many hosts per subnet
- This is usually required for public IPv4 address space within the DMZ
- This will most likely include using VLSM
- The address plan includes how host addresses will be assigned, which hosts will require static IPv4 addresses, and which hosts can use DHCP for obtaining their addressing information
- Within a network, there are different types of devices that require addresses: end user clients, servers and peripherals, servers that are accessible from the internet, intermediary devices, and gateways
- When developing an IP addressing scheme, have a set pattern of how addresses are allocated to each type of device
- This helps when adding and removing devices, filtering traffic based on IP, as well as simplifying documentation
