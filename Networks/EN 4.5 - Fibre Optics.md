# Fibre Optic: Properties
- not as common as Copper cables
- transmits over longer distances
- higher bandwidths
- less attenuation
- completely immune to EMI and RFI
- commonly used to interconnect network devices

## physical properties
- flexible
- extremely thin
- strand of very pure glass
- bits encoded as light impulses
- cable acts as wave guide

# Types of Fibre Media
## 1. single mode
- very small core
- laser tech to send single ray of light
- popular in long distance situations (hundreds of kilometres)

## 2. Multimode
- larger core
- uses LED emitters
- LED enters fibre at different angles
- bandwidth - 10 Gbps over 550 meters

# fibre optics usage
1. **Enterprise networks** - backbone of cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices
2. **Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH)** - always-on broadband services to homes and small businesses
3. **Long-Haul Networks** - connect countries and cities
4. **Submarine Cable networks** - reliable high speed, high capacity connection undersea for transoceanic distances

# connectors
yellow - single mode
orange or aqua - multimode

## 4 types
1. **Straight-Tip (ST) Connectors**
	- first types used
	- twist-on/twist-off bayonet style mechanism
2. **Subscriber Connector (SC) Connectors**
	- square connectors / standard connectors
	- widely adopted LAN and WAN Connectors
	- push pull mechanism
	- used with multimode and single mode fibre
3. **Lucent Connector (LC) Simplex Connectors**
	- smaller version of SC connectors
4. **Duplex Multimode LC Connectors**
	- similar to LC connector but uses a duplex connector

## full duplex in fibre optics
- light could only travel in one direction over optical fibre until recently
- two fibres were needed for full duplex connection
- thus 2 cables bundled together and terminated using single fibre connectors
- some accept both cables in a single connector (Duplex Connector)

# fibre patch cords
fibre optic cable capped at either end with connectors that allow it to be rapidly and conveniently connected to networking devices

| patch cord type | colour | cable type  |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| SC-SC           | orange | multimode   |
| LC-LC           | yellow | single mode |
| ST-LC           | orange | multimode   |
| SC-ST           | yellow | single mode |
