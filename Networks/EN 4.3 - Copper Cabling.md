# Copper cable
- most common type of cabling used in networks
- inexpensive
- limitations
	- attenuation
	- signal prone to interference 
		- EMI or RFI can corrupt the signals
		- fluorescent lights and electric motors
- mitigation
	- maintain adherence to cable length
	- use metallic shielding and grounding
	- twisting cable mitigate the issue of crosstalk between two wires


>[!NOTE]
>CROSSTALK - disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of a signal of one wire to the signal of the adjacent wire

# Types of cables
1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
3. Coaxial Cable

# UTP
- terminated with ***RJ-45 connectors***
- used for interconnecting host devices with intermediary devices
- 4 pairs of colour-coded wires

---
# STP
- same connectors
- better noise protection than UTP
- more expensive
- difficult to install
- each pair is contained in ***foil shields***
- all pairs are then contained in a ***braided foil shield***
- then an *outer jacket*
- if not grounded properly, the shield may act as an antenna and pickup unwanted signals

# Coaxial Cables
- two conductors share same axis
- consists of 
	- outer jacket
	- braided copper shielding - reduces EMI
	- plastic insulation
	- copper conductor
- different types of connectors
	- BNC - Bayonet Neill-Concelman
	- N-type
	- F-type
