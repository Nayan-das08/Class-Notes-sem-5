## [[EN 3.4 - layered models (OSI and TCP-IP)|Layered Model]]
- Each protocol in a protocol suite is classified/categorized in one of the several layers
- Each layer is responsible for various aspects of networking

## Internet Protocol Suite or TCP/IP
- most common and relevant suite
- has a 4 layer approach
- maintained by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

## OSI protocols
- developed by International Org for Standardization (ISO) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
- include a seven layer approach -  [[EN 3.4 - layered models (OSI and TCP-IP)#OSI Reference Model|OSI Reference Model]]
- replaced by TCP/IP

## AppleTalk
- developed by Apple Inc. for Apple devices
- short-lived
- replaced by TCP/IP

## Novell Netware
- developed by Novell Inc.
- replaced by TCP/IP

---

# TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- available for Application, Transport and Internet layers
- not for Network Access layer
