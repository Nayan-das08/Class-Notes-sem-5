# 1 Communication Funda
- a sender/source
- a receiver/destination
- a media/channel

# 2 Process of communication in computer networks
message source -> transmitter -> transmission medium -> receiver ->message destination

>[!NOTE]
>All communications are governed by ***protocols***

Protocols = rules

# 3 Rule Establishment
establishing the rules before communicating

## 3.1 Protocols must account following
- identified sender and receiver
- common language and grammar (rules of language)
	- if not present we need an interpreter
- speed and timing of delivery
- confirmation/acknowledgement

# 4 Protocol Req
## 4.1 message encoding
process of converting info into another acceptable form of transmission
decoding reverses the process to interpret the message

message source -> **encoder** -> transmitter -> transmission medium -> receiver -> **decoder** -> message destination

## 4.2 message formatting and encapsulation
message must have a proper format/structure
the format depends on the type of message

## 4.3 message size
the message sent is broken into small packets of fixed size
thus, size is an important factor
the msg must meet minimum and max size requirements




- message timing
- message delivery options
