| ---- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | 4     | We try to have set procedures or protocols to ensure that things are orderly and run smoothly (e.g. minimize interruptions; everyone gets the opportunity to have their say). |
| 2.   | 1     | We are quick to get on with the task on hand and do not spend too much time in the planning stage                                                                             |
| 3.   | 5     | Our team feels that we are all in it together and shares responsibilities for the team's success or failure.                                                                  |
| 4.   | 4     | We have thorough procedures for agreeing on our objectives and planning the way we will perform our tasks.                                                                    |
| 5.   | 3     | Team members are afraid or do not like to ask others for help                                                                                                                 |
| 6.   | 5     | We take our team's goals and objectives literally, and assume a shared understanding.                                                                                         |
| 7.   | 5     | The team leader tries to keep order and contributes to the task at hand.                                                                                                      |
| 8.   | 4     | We do not have fixed procedures, we make them up as the task or project progresses.                                                                                           |
| 9.   | 4     | We generate lots of ideas, but we do not use many because we fail to listen to them and reject them without fully understanding them.                                         |
| 10.  | 2     | Team members do not fully trust the other team members and closely monitor others who are working on a specific task.                                                         |
| 11.  | 5     | The team leader ensures that we follow the procedures, do not argue, do not interrupt, and keep to the point                                                                  |
| 12.  | 4     | We enjoy working together; we have a fun and productive time.                                                                                                                 |
| 13.  | 5     | We have accepted each other as members of the team.                                                                                                                           |
| 14.  | 5     | The team leader is democratic and collaborative.                                                                                                                              |
| 15.  | 5     | We are trying to define the goal and what tasks need to be accomplished.                                                                                                      |
| 16.  | 4     | Many of the team members have their own ideas about the process and personal agendas are rampant.                                                                             |
| 17.  | 3     | We fully accept each other's strengths and weaknesses.                                                                                                                        |
| 18.  | 5     | We assign specific roles to team members (team leader, facilitator, time keeper, note taker, etc.).                                                                           |
| 19.  | 4     | We try to achieve harmony by avoiding conflict.                                                                                                                               |
| 20.  | 1     | The tasks are very different from what we imagined and seem very difficult to accomplish.                                                                                     |
| 21.  | 2     | There are many abstract discussions of the concepts and issues, which make some members impatient with these discussions                                                      |
| 22.  | 5     | We are able to work through group problems.                                                                                                                                   |
| 23.  | 3     | We are able to work through group problems.                                                                                                                                   |
| 24.  | 4     | The team is often tempted to go above the original scope of the project.                                                                                                      |
| 25.  | 4     | We express criticism of others constructively.                                                                                                                                |
| 26.  | 5     | There is a close attachment to the team                                                                                                                                       |
| 27.  | 1     | It seems as if little is being accomplished with the project's goals.                                                                                                         |
| 28.  | 1     | The goals we have established seem unrealistic.                                                                                                                               |
| 29.  | 5     | Although we are not fully sure of the project's goals and issues, we are excited and proud to be on the team.                                                                 |
| 30.  | 4     | We often share personal problems with each other.                                                                                                                             |
| 31.  | 3     | There is a lot of resisting of the tasks on hand and quality improvement approaches.                                                                                          |
| 32.  | 5     | We get a lot of work done.                                                                                                                                                    |
