### Reasons to form a group:
1. Social needs
2. Tendency to feel safer in groups

4. Brainstorming (Idea generation is more with more people) 
5. Increase Self Esteem 

- Team has a stronger collective identity, more close knit & work together with coordinated effort  for a longer period of time as compared to a group. 

### Diff between Work Group & Team
1. Accountability
	- Group = Individual accountability 
	- Team = Mutual + Individual accountability

	- Team = Team Goals (common purpose) 
3. Other characteristics
	- Group = Share info & opinions (less detailed) 
	- Team = Decision-making, problem solving & planning (more detailed) 

### Stages of forming a group (Can be a continuous loop) 
1. Forming (Uncertainty) 
2. Storming (Conflict) 
3. Norming (Strong relationship) 
4. Performing (Doing the task)
