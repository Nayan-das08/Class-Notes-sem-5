# Data Visualization
- The field in Data Analysis that deals with visual representation of data. It graphically plots data and is an effective way to communicate inferences from data. 
- Data Visualization provides an important suite of tools for identifying qualitative understanding. 
- This can be helpful when we try to explore the dataset and extract some information to know about the dataset and can help with identifying corrupt data, outliers and much more.
- In other terms, DV is defined as graphical representation that contains the formation and the data. Data: -log p(x)

## Univariate Data Visualization Techniques
1.     Distribution Plot
2.     Violin Plot
3.     Box and Whisker Plot

## Bivariate Data Visualization Techniques
1.     Line Plot
2.     Bar Plot
3.     Scatter Plot

## Some tools used
1. Seaborn is mainly used for statistics and can perform complex visualization with few commands.
2. Matplotlib is used for basic graph plotting like charts, bar graph etc.
