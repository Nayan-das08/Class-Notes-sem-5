# Lab 3 notes
open CLI of switch
shows the def config and the connected end devices
shows "changed state to up" when device connected to a port, rest of the ports are "down"

router by def in "down" mode, thus shows red

on pressing RETURN we get the prompt `Switch>` i.e. User EXEC mode
we can see statistics and what has been configured so far

for configuring, enter Privileged EXEC mode by entering `enable`

for changing the hostname, enter into global config mode using `configure terminal`

change the name using `hostname <some-name>`

change hostname
enable secret class
config ip address
save config

whats the diff bw CLI and console terminal

`copy running-config startup-config`
