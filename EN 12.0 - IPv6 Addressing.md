## summary
### IPv4 Issues
- IPv4 has a theoretical maximum of 4.3 billion addresses
- Private addresses in combination with NAT have helped to slow the depletion of IPv4 address space
- With an increasing internet population, a limited IPv4 address space, issues with NAT and the IoT, the time has come to begin the transition to IPv6
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist in the near future and the transition will take several years
- The IETF has created various protocols and tools to help network administrators migrate their networks to IPv6
- The migration techniques can be divided into three categories: dual stack, tunneling, and translation

### IPv6 Address Representation
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimal values
- Every 4 bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values
- The preferred format for writing an IPv6 address is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, with each x consisting of four hexadecimal values
- For example: 2001:0db8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200
- Two rules that help to reduce the number of digits needed to represent an IPv6 address
- The first rule to help reduce the notation of IPv6 addresses is to omit any leading 0s (zeros) in any hextet
- For example: 2001:db8:0:1111:0:0:0:200
- The second rule to help reduce the notation of IPv6 addresses is that a double colon (::) can replace any single, contiguous string of one or more 16-bit hextets consisting of all zeros
- For example: 2001:db8:0:1111::200

### IPv6 Address Types
- There are three types of IPv6 addresses: unicast, multicast, and anycast
- IPv6 does not use the dotted-decimal subnet mask notation
- Like IPv4, the prefix length is represented in slash notation and is used to indicate the network portion of an IPv6 address
- An IPv6 unicast address uniquely identifies an interface on an IPv6-enabled device
- IPv6 addresses typically have two unicast addresses: GUA and LLA
- IPv6 unique local addresses have the following uses: they are used for local addressing within a site or between a limited number of sites, they can be used for devices that will never need to access another network, and they are not globally routed or translated to a global IPv6 address
- IPv6 global unicast addresses (GUAs) are globally unique and routable on the IPv6 internet
- These addresses are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses
- A GUA has three parts: a global routing prefix, a subnet ID, and an interface ID
- An IPv6 link-local address (LLA) enables a device to communicate with other IPv6-enabled devices on the same link and only on that link (subnet)
- Devices can obtain an LLA either statically or dynamically

### GUA and LLA Static Configuration
-  The Cisco IOS command to configure an IPv4 address on an interface is **ip address** _ip-address subnet-mask_
- In contrast, the command to configure an IPv6 GUA on an interface is **ipv6 address** _ipv6-address/prefix-length_
- Just as with IPv4, configuring static addresses on clients does not scale to larger environments
- For this reason, most network administrators in an IPv6 network will enable dynamic assignment of IPv6 addresses
- Configuring the LLA manually lets you create an address that is recognizable and easier to remember
- Typically, it is only necessary to create recognizable LLAs on routers
- LLAs can be configured manually using the **ipv6 address** _ipv6-link-local-address_ **link-local** command

### Dynamic Addressing for IPv6 GUAs
- A device obtains a GUA dynamically through ICMPv6 messages
- IPv6 routers periodically send out ICMPv6 RA messages, every 200 seconds, to all IPv6-enabled devices on the network
- An RA message will also be sent in response to a host sending an ICMPv6 RS message, which is a request for an RA message
- The ICMPv6 RA message includes: network prefix and prefix length, default gateway address, and the DNS addresses and domain name
- RA messages have three methods: SLAAC, SLAAC with a stateless DHCPv6 server, and stateful DHCPv6 (no SLAAC)
- With SLAAC, the client device uses the information in the RA message to create its own GUA because the message contains the prefix and the interface ID
- With SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6 the RA message suggests devices use SLAAC to create their own IPv6 GUA, use the router LLA as the default gateway address, and use a stateless DHCPv6 server to obtain other necessary information
- With stateful DHCPv6 the RA suggests that devices use the router LLA as the default gateway address, and the stateful DHCPv6 server to obtain a GUA, a DNS server address, domain name and all other necessary information
- The interface ID can be created using the EUI-64 process or a randomly generated 64-bit number
- The EUIs process uses the 48-bit Ethernet MAC address of the client and inserts another 16 bits in the middle of MAC address to create a 64-bit interface ID
- Depending upon the operating system, a device may use a randomly generated interface ID

### Dynamic Addressing for IPv6 LLAs
- All IPv6 devices must have an IPv6 LLA
- An LLA can be configured manually or created dynamically
- Operating systems, such as Windows, will typically use the same method for both a SLAAC-created GUA and a dynamically assigned LLA
- Cisco routers automatically create an IPv6 LLA whenever a GUA is assigned to the interface
- By default, Cisco IOS routers use EUI-64 to generate the Interface ID for all LLAs on IPv6 interfaces
- For serial interfaces, the router will use the MAC address of an Ethernet interface
- To make it easier to recognize and remember these addresses on routers, it is common to statically configure IPv6 LLAs on routers
- To verify IPv6 address configuration use the following three commands: **show ipv6 interface brief**, **show ipv6 route**, and **ping**

### IPv6 Multicast Addresses
- There are two types of IPv6 multicast addresses: well-known multicast addresses and solicited node multicast addresses
- Assigned multicast addresses are reserved multicast addresses for predefined groups of devices
- Well-known multicast addresses are assigned
- Two commonIPv6 assigned multicast groups are: ff02::1 All-nodes multicast group and ff02::2 All-routers multicast group
- A solicited-node multicast address is similar to the all-nodes multicast address
- The advantage of a solicited-node multicast address is that it is mapped to a special Ethernet multicast address

### Subnet an IPv6 Network
- IPv6 was designed with subnetting in mind
- A separate subnet ID field in the IPv6 GUA is used to create subnets
- The subnet ID field is the area between the Global Routing Prefix and the interface ID
- The benefit of a 128-bit address is that it can support more than enough subnets and hosts per subnet for each network
- Address conservation is not an issue
- For example, if the global routing prefix is a /48, and using a typical 64 bits for the interface ID, this will create a 16-bit subnet ID:
	-   16-bit subnet ID - Creates up to 65,536 subnets.
	-   64-bit interface ID - Supports up to 18 quintillion host IPv6 addresses per subnet (i.e., 18,000,000,000,000,000,000).
- With over 65,536 subnets to choose from, the task of the network administrator becomes one of designing a logical scheme to address the network
- Address conservation is not a concern when using IPv6
- Similar to configuring IPv4, each router interface can be configured to be on a different IPv6 subnet
