## summary
### Configure Initial Router Settings
The following tasks should be completed when configuring initial settings on a router.
1.  Configure the device name.
2.  Secure privileged EXEC mode.
3.  Secure user EXEC mode.
4.  Secure remote Telnet / SSH access.
5.  Secure all passwords in the config file.
6.  Provide legal notification.
7.  Save the configuration.

### Configure Interfaces
- For routers to be reachable, the router interfaces must be configured
- The Cisco ISR 4321 router is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces: `GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 (G0/0/0) and GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 (G0/0/1)`
- The tasks to configure a router interface are very similar to a management SVI on a switch
- Using the no shutdown command activates the interface
- The interface must also be connected to another device, such as a switch or a router, for the physical layer to be active
- There are several commands that can be used to verify interface configuration including the `show ip interface brief` and `show ipv6 interface brief`, the `show ip route` and `show ipv6 route`, as well as `show interfaces`, `show ip interface` and `show ipv6 interface`

### Configure the Default Gateway
- For an end device to communicate over the network, it must be configured with the correct IP address information, including the default gateway address
- The default gateway address is generally the router interface address for the router that is attached to the local network of the host
- The IP address of the host device and the router interface address must be in the same network
- To connect to and manage a switch over a local IP network, it must have a switch virtual interface (SVI) configured
- The SVI is configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask on the local LAN
- The switch must also have a default gateway address configured to remotely manage the switch from another network
- To configure an IPv4 default gateway on a switch, use the `ip default-gateway ip-address` global configuration command
- Use the IPv4 address of the local router interface that is connected to the switch
